contains only prefixes? (no values)

"log log u levels" "where u is the size of the key space"

X-Fast Trie
p levels?


Find:
Look into hash table.
404? Go up until found
Found something? Go back down
	if value is higher than desired: go left until value is <= than desired
	search through the skiplist
	


Insert:
Insert into the skiplist from bottom to top,
if top is reached keep track of pointer and add to x-tree (top to bottom)
x-tree connects to 2 pointers, create as many levels as necessary

Delete:
