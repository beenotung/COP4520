X-Fast Trie
p levels?


Find:
Look through the X-Fast's bottom level hash table
for a pointer to the matching top of the skilist


Insert:
Insert into the skiplist from bottom to top,
if top is reached keep track of pointer and add to x-tree (top to bottom)
x-tree connects to 2 pointers, create as many levels as necessary

Delete:
