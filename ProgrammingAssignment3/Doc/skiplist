each node has a marked bit (supposedly stored w/ the pointer)

nextpointer = 
newnode.next = nextpointer



//back pointer to recover if node is deleted (already in place)

boolean flag "stop" to stop insertion upon deletion


funct listSearch(x,start) returns left.key<k<=right.key (for cleanup, unlinks)

Each insertion is conditioned on the
stop flag of the root remaining unset.
